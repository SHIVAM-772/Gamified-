  <h1>Areas of Parallelograms and Triangles</h1>

  <p>
    This chapter explores the relationship between the areas of parallelograms and triangles 
    lying on the same base and between the same parallels. It also introduces important 
    theorems used to calculate areas and solve problems in geometry.
  </p>

  <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
  <div class="section">
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Parallelogram:</strong> A quadrilateral with opposite sides parallel and equal in length.</li>
      <li><strong>Triangle:</strong> A polygon with three sides and three angles.</li>
      <li><strong>Base:</strong> The side on which a figure stands.</li>
      <li><strong>Altitude:</strong> The perpendicular distance from the base to the opposite side (or vertex).</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h2>Important Theorems</h2>
  <div class="section">
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Parallelograms on the Same Base and Between the Same Parallels:</strong><br>
          Parallelograms lying on the same base and between the same parallels are equal in area.</li>
      <li><strong>Triangles on the Same Base and Between the Same Parallels:</strong><br>
          Triangles lying on the same base and between the same parallels are equal in area.</li>
      <li><strong>Parallelogram-Triangle Relation:</strong><br>
          A triangle and a parallelogram on the same base and between the same parallels have the 
          ratio of their areas as 1:2 (triangle is half the area of the parallelogram).</li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <h2>Key Formulas</h2>
  <div class="section">
    <ul>
      <li>Area of a Parallelogram = <strong>Base × Height</strong></li>
      <li>Area of a Triangle = <strong>½ × Base × Height</strong></li>
      <li>Heron’s Formula for a triangle (when all sides are known):<br>
          Area = √[s(s−a)(s−b)(s−c)], where s = (a + b + c) / 2</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h2>Properties</h2>
  <div class="section">
    <ul>
      <li>Parallelograms between the same parallels and on equal bases have equal areas.</li>
      <li>If a triangle and a parallelogram are on the same base and between the same parallels,
          the area of the triangle is half the area of the parallelogram.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h2>Solved Examples</h2>
  <div class="section">
    <ol>
      <li>
        Two parallelograms are on the same base and between the same parallels. 
        The area of one is 72 cm². Find the area of the other.<br>
        <strong>Solution:</strong> By theorem, their areas are equal.<br>
        Area of the second parallelogram = <strong>72 cm²</strong>.
      </li><br>
      <li>
        A triangle and a parallelogram are on the same base and between the same parallels. 
        If the area of the parallelogram is 50 cm², find the area of the triangle.<br>
        <strong>Solution:</strong> Area of triangle = ½ × Area of parallelogram = <strong>25 cm²</strong>.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <h2>Real-Life Application</h2>
  <div class="section">
    <p>
      These properties are used in **land surveying**, **architecture**, and **engineering** to 
      calculate areas of plots and structures where direct measurement of altitude is not possible.
